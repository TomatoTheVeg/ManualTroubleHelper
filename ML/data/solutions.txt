	12.	Info: Low signal strength, moving to better location
	•	Explanation: The robot is experiencing low signal strength and is moving to a location with better network coverage. Ensure there are no obstacles in its path.
	•	Citation: Network signal commands and statuses (Page 91).
	13.	Info: Alignment successful, ready for task
	•	Explanation: The robot has successfully aligned itself and is ready to perform the assigned task. Assign the next task as needed.
	•	Citation: Alignment and task-related commands (Page 105).
	14.	Info: Idle, no pending tasks
	•	Explanation: The robot is currently idle with no pending tasks. Assign a new task to keep the robot operational.
	•	Citation: Task queue commands such as queueShow (Page 247).




	To provide a solution for the error “Error: Failed going to goal,” we can follow these steps:

	1.	Check for Obstacles:
	•	Ensure there are no physical obstacles blocking the robot’s path. This can involve physically inspecting the path or using the robot’s sensors to detect and clear obstacles.
	2.	Verify Map Accuracy:
	•	Ensure that the map the robot is using is accurate and up-to-date. Any changes in the environment should be reflected in the robot’s map.
	3.	Check Goal Coordinates:
	•	Verify that the coordinates of the goal are correctly specified and reachable within the current map.
	4.	Inspect Navigation System:
	•	Ensure that the robot’s navigation system is functioning correctly, including its localization and path-planning algorithms.
	5.	Review ARCL Commands:
	•	Use relevant ARCL commands to troubleshoot and debug the issue. Commands such as goto and queueShow can help in diagnosing the problem.

Relevant Sections in the Adept ARCL Reference Guide:

	•	Navigating and Localizing (Page 65):
	•	This section provides information on commands related to navigating and localizing the robot. Commands like goto and getGoals can help ensure the goal is correctly set and reachable.
	•	Status and Error Messages (Page 50):
	•	This section lists various status and error messages, including “Error: Failed going to goal.” It provides context for understanding the error and potential steps to resolve it.
	•	ARCL Command Reference (Page 70):
	•	This section contains detailed descriptions of ARCL commands. Commands like goto (Page 135) and queueShow (Page 247) are particularly relevant for diagnosing navigation errors.

Specific ARCL Commands to Use:

	1.	goto :
	•	Use this command to send the robot to a specific goal.
	•	Syntax: goto <goalName>
	•	Example: goto DockingStation
	2.	queueShow:
	•	Use this command to show the current task queue and check if the goal is correctly queued.
	•	Syntax: queueShow
	•	Example: queueShow
	3.	clearAllObstacles:
	•	Use this command to clear any detected obstacles from the robot’s path.
	•	Syntax: clearAllObstacles
	•	Example: clearAllObstacles


Example Solution Steps:

	1.	Check for Obstacles: clearAllObstacles

	2.	Verify Goal and Navigation: getGoals, goto <goalName>

	3.	Review Task Queue: queueShow

	By following these steps and using the relevant commands from the Adept ARCL Reference Guide, you can diagnose and resolve the “Error: Failed going to goal” issue effectively.
