    "# Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop an AI/LLM solution that bridges this digital divide. Specifically, your solution should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interpret and Explain Error Codes/Messages**:\n",
    "   - Utilize the provided PDF containing a user manual and real machine error codes/messages.\n",
    "   - The AI should accurately interpret these codes/messages and provide clear, understandable explanations to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enhance Accessibility**:\n",
    "   - Focus on making the technology accessible to all, particularly older adults and those less familiar with digital tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplify User Interaction**:\n",
    "   - Design the user interface to be intuitive and user-friendly, reducing complexity and making technology more approachable for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support your development, we will provide real machine data and a comprehensive machine manual. These resources will help you create a solution that is both practical and applicable to real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that technology becomes an aid, not a hindrance, in people's lives. Your solution should empower users, allowing them to maintain control over technology and derive genuine personal value from it."
